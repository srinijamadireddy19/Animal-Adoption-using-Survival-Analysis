The US animal shelters house stray or unwanted animals and are vital to animal welfare. Survival analysis 
methods are used here on Austin Animal Center (2013â€“2025) intake and outcome data to find factors 
influencing animal adoption time. The aim is to estimate how different characteristics (e.g., age, sex, type of 
intake) impact the time animals spend in shelters prior to adoption. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank 
tests are applied to compare group adoption survival (e.g., species, sex). A multivariate model is created to test 
the impact of multiple features on adoption velocity. The outcomes provide actionable insights that can inform 
shelters on how to improve adoption approaches and shorten animal wait times.
